YAY OPTIONS (APPLY TO -Y AND --YAY)
       <NO OPTION>
              Displays  a  list  of  packages matching the search terms and prompts the user on which
              packages to install (yogurt mode).

--
SHOW OPTIONS (APPLY TO -P AND --show)
       -c, --complete
              Print a list of all AUR and repo packages. This allows  shell  completion  and  is  not
              intended to be used directly by the user.

--
              Passes  arguments  to  the  editor.  These flags get passed to every instance where the
              editor is called by Yay. Arguments are split on whitespace before being passed  to  the
              editor.  Multiple  arguments  may be passed by supplying a space separated list that is
              quoted by the shell.

--

       --singlelineresults
              Override  pacman's  usual  double-line search result format and list each result on its
              own line.

       --doublelineresults
              Follow pacman's double-line search result format and list each result using two lines.

       --devel
--
              not require the original pkgbuild to be downloaded.

              The  slower  pacaur-like  devel  checks can be implemented manually by piping a list of
              packages into yay (see examples).

--

       --useask
              Use pacman's --ask flag to automatically confirm package conflicts. Yay lists conflicts
              ahead of time. It is possible that Yay does not detect a conflict, causing a package to
              be removed without the user's confirmation.  However, this is very unlikely.
--
              Passes  arguments to makepkg. These flags get passed to every instance where makepkg is
              called by Yay. Arguments are split  on  whitespace  before  being  passed  to  makepkg.
              Multiple  arguments may be passed by supplying a space separated list that is quoted by
              the shell.

--
              Passes arguments to gpg. These flags get passed to every instance where gpg  is  called
              by  Yay.  Arguments  are  split  on  whitespace  before  being  passed to gpg. Multiple
              arguments may be passed by supplying a space separated  list  that  is  quoted  by  the
              shell.

--
              Passes arguments to sudo. These flags get passed to every instance where sudo is called
              by  Yay.  Arguments  are  split  on  whitespace  before  being passed to sudo. Multiple
              arguments may be passed by supplying a space separated  list  that  is  quoted  by  the
              shell.

--

       yay -Syu
              Update package list and upgrade all currently installed repo and AUR.

       yay -Sua
--
              directory will fall back to $HOME/.cache/yay.

              completion.cache holds a list  of  of  all  packages,  including  the  AUR,  for  shell
              completion. By default the completion files are refreshed every 7 days.
